# My notes

I have gone to some effort to get setup on my machine with my gpu working. I am on ubuntu with a gtx 1650 ti.

One will need to also setup there own macbine with variuos downloading of software from nvidia. I am instructions inside my obisidan notebook (private).

However once you have that setup there is a conda enviroment ready to go. Just run `conda activiate ./envs`.
